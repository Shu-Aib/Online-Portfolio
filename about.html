    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h3>My Academics</h3>
    <p>I’m excited to share my journey in Information and Communications Technology. I earned a Higher Certificate in ICT from the College of Cape Town and completed my Microsoft certification, gaining essential IT skills.

        At the Cape Peninsula University of Technology, I focused on software development, network management, and data analysis, which sharpened my technical and critical thinking abilities.
        
        As a Software Development Intern at CapaCiTi, I applied my knowledge in developing software solutions and troubleshooting, further igniting my passion for the field.</p>

        <h3>My Hobbies</h3>
        <p>Outside of work, I enjoy camping, fishing, hiking, and sports like soccer and rugby, which nurture my love for the outdoors and teamwork. Gaming is also a creative outlet for me.
        
        In summary, my education and hands-on experience have prepared me well for the tech industry, and I’m eager for future opportunities.</p>
